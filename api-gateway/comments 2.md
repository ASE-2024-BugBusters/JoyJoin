# Deliverable 1
For this deliverable, I was mostly working on the setup and the microservices architecture. It took much more time than expected
to setup the whole project properly with all the required things and lot of new stuff to learn and to include in the project.
The dockerization works properly and is the application can be run with a docker-compose file. The whole pipline is also working
where the code is build and then sent to dockerhub and also the code-quality is checked by Qodana. I also started with the design of the 
application and provided a first mockup. I started with the registration and login of the user.
