# Event Service Microservice

## Overview

The Event Service microservice manages all aspects of event handling within our application, including creation, modification, retrieval, deletion, registration, and rating of events.

## Features

- Create, update, and delete events.
- Register and unregister for events.
- Retrieve event details, including by filters like title, date, and location.
- Manage event images through AWS S3.
- Handle event ratings.

## Prerequisites

- Java 8 or higher
- Maven for dependency management

## External Dependencies

### Database

The database is used for persisting application data including user information, transaction records, and other operational data critical for service functionality.

Database configurations are specified in the `application.yml` file. By default, the service expects a PostgreSQL database named `eventService` running at port `5434`. The default username and password can be found in the configuration file.

### Amazon S3 Storage

Amazon S3 is used for storing large files, such as event images uploaded by users, that are part of the applicationâ€™s data.

S3 configurations are specified in the `application.yml` file as well.

Interactions with S3 utilized a stand-alone library named `libs3`, which can be found at `/path/to/JoyJoin/libs3/`.

#### Event Controller
Handles all HTTP requests related to events, including CRUD operations and registrations. Endpoints are documented with JavaDoc for clarity and ease of use.

### Models

- **Event**: Represents the primary entity for an event.
- **Event Registration**: Manages registration data with `registrationId`, `eventId`, and `userId` as key identifiers.
- **Event Registration Count**: Updates and checks event participation counts.
- **Image Ref/Image Url**: Manages image storage and retrieval details.
- **Rating**: Manages event rating data.
- **Location/Tag**: Represents detailed components of an event such as location and tags.

### DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

- **EventDto**: Facilitates event data transfer between server and clients.
- **EventRegistrationDto**: Manages data transfer for event registrations.
- **LocationDto**: Carries detailed location information within an event.
- **PostEventRequest**: Structures request data for creating events.
- **UpdateEventRequest**: Structures request data for updating events.

### Services

- **EventService**: Manages event lifecycle, including creation, updates, and retrieval using various filters.
