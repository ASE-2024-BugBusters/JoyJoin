## External Dependencies

### Database

The database is used for persisting application data including user information, transaction records, and other operational data critical for service functionality.

Database configurations are specified in the `application.yml` file. By default, the service expects a PostgreSQL database named `postService` running at port `5435`. The default username and password can be found in the configuration file.

### Amazon S3 Storage

Amazon S3 is used for storing large files, such as post images uploaded by users, that are part of the applicationâ€™s data.

S3 configurations are specified in the `application.yml` file as well.

Interactions with S3 utilized a stand-alone library named `libs3`, which can be found at `/path/to/JoyJoin/libs3/`.

### User Service Microservice
